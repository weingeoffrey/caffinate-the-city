# Caffeinate The City

## Description
The purpose of Caffinate the City is to provide residents and/or tourists to Austin, TX a resource to find locally owned coffee shops without any corporate chains muddying the waters. 

A list of 30 coffee shops are displayed on a map overview of Austin that allows the end user to select the coffee shop of their choice to get an idea of where it is located.

Upon selecting the coffee shop icon on the map, a bubble is displayed with the coffee shop's name, address and website. 

The map is completely interactive with traffic updates, satellite viewas well as 3D building modeling. 

There is also a section that allows the end user to input their address and their address will be geolocated and directions will be displayed on the map to their desired coffee shop as well as written directions

The website is mobile friendly
